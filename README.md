# My Personal Website

Welcome to my little corner of the web - a playground for ideas, projects, and questions.

Here are some problems that I want to work on eventually:
- robotics for agriculture and construction, as well as robotics that can augument human actions
- Novel transportation solutions such as high speed trains and city transportation systems
- education technology that can make education accessible and equitable
- architectural design and creating spaces where people feel inspired
- sustainable energy - particularly nuclear fusion and solar energy
- creating robust materials and design for the future
