# 🧠 My Personal Website

Welcome to my little corner of the web — a playground for ideas, projects, and digital experiments.

This website is hosted via **GitHub Pages** and built to showcase:
- 🔬 Research summaries (AI, finance, physics, and beyond)
- 🤖 Open-source projects and agents
- 📈 Investment theses and financial modeling tools
- 🧩 Blog posts on math, code, systems, and strategies
- 💡 Unreasonably ambitious ideas and half-working prototypes

> **Description:**  
> *Brain dumps, bots, and bold ideas — a nerd's playground for AI, quant finance, and code experiments.*
